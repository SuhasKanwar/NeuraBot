Hello! I'm Pratyaksh Saluja, a dedicated student pursuing Computer
Science and Engineering at BML Munjal University, with an
anticipated graduation year of 2027.
Academic Journey:
My academic journey is centered on cultivating a deep
understanding of computer science. I'm well-versed in C++ and data
structures, and I'm currently exploring modern C++ (C++17-20) to
enhance my coding practices.
Technical Proficiency:
Alongside my academic pursuits, I've developed practical skills
in Python, utilizing libraries like NumPy, Pandas, SymPy, and
Matplotlib. These tools have enriched my toolkit for data analysis and
visualization.
SIH Finals Achievement:
In an exciting venture, I had the privilege of leading a team that
advanced to the finals of the Smart India Hackathon (SIH) in my very
first semester. It was an incredible experience, and the journey as a
team leader added a valuable layer to my learning curve.
️ Self-Learning Enthusiast:
While I haven't undertaken specific DSA projects, I've actively delved
into the world of data structures and algorithms by studying and
understanding ready-made projects. This self-learning approach has
deepened my comprehension of these fundamental concepts.
